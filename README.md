# Express Project Generator

A generator for Express.js projects with database connections, caching, and MVC/API structures.

---

## Features

- **Express.js Project Templates**: Generate projects with MVC or API structures.
- **Database Integration**: Connect to major databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLServer.
- **View Engine Support**: Optional setup for popular view engines (EJS, Pug, Handlebars) for MVC projects.
- **Demo Included**: Provides a basic weather model, controller, and API endpoint as an example.
- **Customizable**: Interactive CLI allows you to configure projects according to your requirements.

## Installation

Install the generator globally to use it as a CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g @arya2004/auto-express
```

---

## Usage

### **Start an Interactive CLI**

To initialize a new project with interactive prompts:

```bash
auto init
```

### **Generate a New Express API Project**

To quickly create a new API project with a specified name:

```bash
auto new my-express-api
```

This command sets up a new Express.js API project with MongoDB integration and basic scaffolding.

### **Using Environment Variables**

Many projects need secrets like database URLs or API keys. You can use a .env file along with dotenv.
1. Install dotenv in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```
2. Create a .env file in the root of your project:
   Example -
   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
   ```
3. Load variables in your server.js or app.js:
   ```bash
   import express from "express";
   import dotenv from "dotenv";
    
   dotenv.config();
    
   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    
   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send("Hello from Auto Express ðŸš€");
   });
   ```

### **Display Help**

To see all available commands and options, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
auto --help
```
